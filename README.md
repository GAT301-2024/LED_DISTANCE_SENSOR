# Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LED Indicators

This project demonstrates the use of an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) with an Arduino Uno to measure the distance to an object. The measured distance is indicated by lighting up a series of LEDs. Each LED corresponds to a specific distance range.
